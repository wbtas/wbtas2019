# 1st International Workshop of Blockchain Technology and Analysis for Security
## Call for Papers

A blockchain is a distributed ledger for recording transactions, maintained by many nodes without central authority
through a distributed cryptographic protocol. All nodes validate the information to be appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in which entries are appended. This prominent feature of blockchain is well known after the success of its early digital cryptocurrency applications known as Bitcoin.
Nowadays more and more innovative applications are using blockchain to explore many new innovative digital financial
applications and various decentralized applications that eliminate the need for 3rd party intermediaries, such as identity
management, credit management, distrusted/public/shared ledger, crowd-funding, P2P insurance, smart contracts, supply
chain management, online voting, medical records etc.  We aim to advance the state of the art in security of blockchain technology and analysis.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working in distributed systems, cryptography,
and security, from academia and industry, who are interested in the technology and analysis of blockchains and
their protocols.



## Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be evaluated by the track co-chairs. The evaluation will focus on the novelty, originality, and importance to the field of the workshop topics, and on the adequate structure of proposed sessions.


## Submission Instructions
Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- The Bitcoin protocol and extensions (cryptography, scripting language etc.)
- Applications using or built on top of Bitcoin
- New applications of blockchain technology
- Permissioned and permissionless blockchains
- Cryptocurrency adoption and transition dynamics
- Transaction graph analysis
- Fraud detection and financial crime prevention
- Economics and game theoretic analysis of cryptocurrency protocols
- Regulation and law enforcement
- Usability and user studies
- Legal, ethical and societal aspects of (decentralized) virtual currencies
- Case studies (e.g., of adoption, attacks, forks, scams,...)

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform, at time of submission, to the IEEE formatting guidelines.
All submissions must not exceed 6 pages (including figures and appendices) plus up to 2 pages that contain ONLY references.

Important note: submissions must be compliant with the double-blind policy. The research papers accepted at this workshop will not be published in this proceeding, but their revised, extended versions will be invited to be submitted for a special issue
of the *IEEE Transaction on Reliability*.
